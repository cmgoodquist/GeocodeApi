# Geocode API
Allows conversion of valid US addresses to latitude/longitude coordinates. Proxies requests to the geocoding API at [geocoding.geo.census.gov](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov), which allows anonymous requests, but applies CORS rules.

# Getting Started
This .NET Core app includes Swagger UI. Once deployed, to view the API surface, navigate to the Swagger endpoint at ```<BASE_URL>/swagger```. For example:
```
http://localhost/geocodeApi/swagger
```
